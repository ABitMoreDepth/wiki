Anyone who has ever tried to google what's actually going on with the planet will know how contentious that enormous topic can be. It's becoming one of those divisive topics not to be discussed around the dinner table alongside politics and religion.

Clearly the human race will continue to build, continue to consume, continue to develop different systems to achieve different things, etc etc. But some people may have questions of sustainability surrounding this collective expansion; the resources we use to build and develop aren't infinite, nor are they replaceable at the rate we use them(1).

We don't have to keep perpetuating environmental damage in order to continue building, nature has already provided the blueprint for sustainable engineering.  From harnessing the suns energy, to dealing with waste, nature's already given us the cheat sheet.

## Bios (life) + mimesis (imitation)

Biomimicry is the imitation of life [1]. It's a way of tapping into the 3.8 billion year old genius that is nature. Not a kind of sentient tree or a personified spirit of the natural world, but the ideas existing in living organisms and their wider communities that could help or solve some of the most pressing issues facing the planet today.

The templates to sustainable, zero waste and energy efficient design are already there, refined and ready to implement, in the natural world. Evolution has done all the heavy lifting, weeding out designs that don't work, resulting in organisms and habitats that cooperate and fit together in a pollution-free jigsaw.

> Things that occur in nature that we have yet to figure out:

* Totally clean energy
* Recycling and utilisation of all waste
* Pollution free building

\"Biomimicry is basically taking a design challenge and then finding an ecosystem that's already solved that challenge, and literally trying to emulate what you learn.\"
Janine Benyus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biomimicry is forging new paths toward these ends, led by Janine Benyus over at the Biomimicry Institute, along with collaborations from universities and industries. Her vision of the future isn't one of a completely forest-covered planet, but of cities and businesses and networks of people that inherently care for the natural world, almost as automatically as someone today could chuck a crisp packet out the car window. Automatic, because the architects, politicians and industry leaders are using time-tested designs and solutions that are innately sustainable, environmentally friendly and maybe even regenerative.

They're also pretty darn cool...

## The Industry of Imitation


1. The Bullet Train

Hideo Shima, a Japanese engineer designed the train that goes crazy fast (200mph)(3) - but with a bullet shaped front to the train, a loud 'tunnel boom' would erupt after exiting the tunnel. Not so great for the surrounding area. This happens because the air around the train outside of a tunnel isn't under much pressure when the bullet train moves through it, but inside a tunnel the air is suddenly under a lot of pressure when the train moves through it, because it's a way smaller area. Eiji Nakatsu, an engineer and a birdwatcher, designed a solution based on his knowledge of a kingfishers ability to move from air to water without a splash (to be able to catch fish). So, think of the water as the train tunnel, the kingfisher as the train, and for no tunnel boom (i.e. no splash) Nakatsu remodelled the nose of the train on that of a kingfisher bill, a design developed through the pressures of survival and therefore a design that he knew must work.

2. Calera Cement

Creating and using one tonne of cement produces around one tonne of carbon dioxide(4). 4.2 billion metric tonnes of cement and therefore 4.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was produced worldwide in 2016(5). Let's try to digest that figure for a moment. A mature sycamore tree gets to be around 12m tall, and they store about 1 tonne of carbon in their roots, trunk and branches(6). Everything sounds nice and balanced right now: 1 tonne cement = 1 tonne CO2 = 1 mature sycamore tree. So to balance out the emissions from that 4.2 billion tonnes of cement last year, we'd need the same number of sycamore trees. Just for cement.  If you took that same amount of trees, lined them up top to bottom, they would reach past the sun(7). The sun.

> Worrying interjection: we are cutting down about 15 billion trees a year(8).

Why bother with all that maths though? Carbon dioxide acts like a snuggly blanket for the atmosphere, raising global temperatures (a.k.a. global warming) (9). Normally, at a local scale temperature change is fine - seasons change after all. But at a global level, that means everyone's seasons get hotter - deserts get bigger(10), ice melts(11), animals get really uncomfortable (particularly animals like polar bears)(12) and generally things start to break like the weather(13), as many Southern and Eastern states of America will be able to verify. But as previously mentioned, things still need building. The ocean, or rather the little creatures in the ocean like coral, actually utilise carbon to build their homes. They harness the carbon in the water around them to convert into a chalk-like substance that's actually pretty tough for it's size (14). Calera Cement is copying this process, trapping carbon dioxide from the air to convert into a similar material, making this part of the building process carbon negative(15) and banking on significantly less trees.

3. Morocco's Fog Harvester

Fishing for clouds, the fog harvester collects and provides drinking water to those in dire need of it in drought-ridden Morocco(16)). Built by Moroccan organisation Dar Si Hamad, more than 400 people who never before had running water now benefit from the system. The idea came from the Darkling beetle: these little guys climb up sand dunes, stand on their heads and collect water from incoming fog, from water vapour condensing on their backs and rolling down to their heads(17). By copying and manufacturing the tiny structures on their backs we can now do the same with mechanisms like the fog harvester and get water to those who most need it.

## One of many in Earth's First Aid Kit

There is no single all-powerful bandage to heal the entire planet in one go, it's more likely an arsenal of answers that will chip away at all the affronts to planetary health. The different approaches to solving global problems all have varying degrees of success, but the biomimicry industry has joined the collective armoury trying to save what's left of the planet, and with it brings the unending depth of knowledge housed in the library of organisms around us.
